# ML-ETL-Project
This repository contains code for an end-to-end Machine Learning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project developed on Databricks, showcasing data processing, model training, and deployment using Flask.

About Dataset
Context
This synthetic healthcare dataset has been created to serve as a valuable resource for data science, machine learning, and data analysis enthusiasts. It is designed to mimic real-world healthcare data, enabling users to practice, develop, and showcase their data manipulation and analysis skills in the context of the healthcare industry.

Inspiration
The inspiration behind this dataset is rooted in the need for practical and diverse healthcare data for educational and research purposes. Healthcare data is often sensitive and subject to privacy regulations, making it challenging to access for learning and experimentation. To address this gap, I have leveraged Python's Faker library to generate a dataset that mirrors the structure and attributes commonly found in healthcare records. By providing this synthetic data, I hope to foster innovation, learning, and knowledge sharing in the healthcare analytics domain.
